# CAMDA 2025 - ELSA Health Privacy Challenge

This repository is a "starter package" for the [Health Privacy Competition](https://benchmarks.elsa-ai.eu/?ch=4&com=introduction) that runs within [CAMDA Conference 2025](https://bipress.boku.ac.at/camda2025/). The  Health Privacy Challenge is organized in the context of the European Lighthouse on Safe and Secure AI (ELSA, https://elsa-ai.eu). 

The Health Privacy Challenge consists of two tracks: 

### Track I: Featuring Bulk RNA-seq 
Track I runs in a ‚ÄúBlue Team (ü´ê)  vs Red Team (üçÖ)‚Äù scheme. 
-  The **blue teams** develop **novel privacy preserving generative methods** that can mitigate privacy risks while preserving biological insights for bulk gene expression datasets,
- The **red teams** launch **trustworthy and realistic membership inference attacks (MIA)** against blue teams‚Äô solutions to assess whether these generative methods can withstand privacy attacks. 


### Track II: Featuring Single-cell RNA-seq 
Track II invites participants to explore the privacy and utility of synthetic single-cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) data. Participants are encouraged to:
- **investigate and reveal potential privacy risks** linked to generating synthetic **scRNA-seq** datasets.
- develop **privacy-preserving generative methods** that balances data privacy and utility.
- propose **novel evaluation metrics and strategies** to assess both utility and privacy preservation in a **multi-sample donor** setting.


We are looking forward to engaging with you and working together to deepen our understanding of privacy in healthcare. :hugs:

## Datasets 

Datasets are available for download in [ELSA Benchmarks Competition platform](https://benchmarks.elsa-ai.eu/?ch=4&com=introduction) after registration and signing the data download agreement. 

### Track I: Featuring bulk RNA-seq
We re-distribute pre-processed versions of two open-access TCGA RNA-seq datasets, available through the  [GDC portal](https://gdc.cancer.gov):

- **TCGA-BRCA RNASeq** 

    **Dimensions:** <1089 x 978> <individuals x landmark genes>
    **Details:** Suitable for cancer subtype prediction (5 subtypes)

- **TCGA COMBINED RNASeq** (with 10 different cancer tissues )

    **Dimensions:** <4323 x 978> <individuals x landmark genes>
    **Details:** Suitable for cancer tissue of origin prediction (10 tissues)

Navigate [here](/data/) for details about the pre-processing steps. 

### Track II: Featuring single-cell RNA-seq 
We re-distribute raw counts of **OneK1K single-cell RNA-seq** dataset (https://onek1k.org/), a cohort containing 1.26 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 981 donors, generously provided by [Joseph Powell](https://www.garvan.org.au/people/researchers/joseph-powell) and the authors (Yazar et al., 2022) in Garvan Institute of Medical Research. 

- **Train dataset:** <633711 cells from 490 donors x 25834 genes > 
- **Test dataset:**  <634022 cells from 491 donors x 25834 genes > 

Navigate [Track II homepage](/experiments/track_ii/) for details about the pre-processing steps.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Evaluation

The teams with the best solutions will be determined based on multiple criteria, including,

- :dart: leaderboard ranking, 
- :bulb: novelty of methods, 
- :seedling: generation of novel privacy preservation insights for biology. 

We strongly encourage the participants to submit their CAMDA extended abstracts for evaluation **even if they might not have high rankings on the leaderboards.** 

The winners will be  invited to present their methods at the CAMDA Conference at ISMB 2025 in Liverpool. Travel fellowships will be available for the selected teams sponsored by ELSA (https://elsa-ai.eu).

## :pushpin: Statement

Membership inference attacks (MIA) aim to re-identify the training data points used to generate synthetic datasets from the original dataset. This re-identification process pertains only to identifying the pseudo-identities within the dataset and **does not, in any way, attempt to re-identify the original donors.**
